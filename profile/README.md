PXP is a superset of the PHP programming language with extended syntax and runtime capabilities.

The project itself covers the development of the transpiler, as well as the backing static analyser that can be used on regular PHP projects too.

For more information about the PXP language, visit [the official website](https://pxplang.org).

If you're interested in the first-party static analyser, Statan, please visit [the repository](https://github.com/pxp-lang/statan).
